# Project2

This code uses the YOLO object detection model and OpenCV to process a video file. It identifies instances of dogs in each frame of the video, drawing bounding boxes around them and overlaying the text "Happy Environment" if a dog is detected. The script reads a pre-trained YOLO model and the COCO class names, then processes the video frame by frame, utilizing the model's output to locate and highlight dogs. This code serves as a tool for identifying and enhancing scenes with dogs within video content, promoting a positive environment.

Two video files are attached to check the accuracy of the code.
